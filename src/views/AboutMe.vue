		<h1>About John Moran</h1>
		<h2>Lets get to the basics:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I love Front End Development and have been doing for quite a long time, over five years. But with the frameworks of Angular, React and Vue, around 2 years professional experience</li>
			<li>I enjoy using a state manageer like Redux, Vuex, NGRX, once you get the concepts for one of them they all start to feel similar</li>
			<li>I've been coding mostly in typescript recently, it can be tricky to pick up and but will make code more readable and robust</li>
			<li>I use <b>Material UI</b> to save time styling out the css</li>
			<li>I'm currently available to start immediately and keen to work for you</li>
			<li>I've been living in Barcelona since 2016, speak fluent Castellano and English, of course, being English</li>
