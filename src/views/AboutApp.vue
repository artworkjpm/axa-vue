		<h1>About this app</h1>
		<h2>Things to impress:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I noticed the job description mentions <b>Vue.js</b> so I decided to use vue version 2, it seems to be the most used and encouraged version to use despite being a version 3 and version 4 soon to be released</li>
			<li>I use <b>Vuex</b> to save the json to the state, I understand the concepts of <b>getters, actions, mutations</b></li>
			<li>I'm only showing 5 characters at a time, this hugely increases performance of the search and page load, I did consider making a pagination but I wanted the app to be as simple as possible</li>
			<li>I use <b>Material UI</b> to save time styling out the css</li>
			<li>I use vue router to show the other pages</li>
			<li>Friends are button that will show that friend when clicked</li>
			<li>Colored hair elements to be more fancy</li>
		</ul>
