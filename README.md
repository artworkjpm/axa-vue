## What is this app

Its a vue.js version 2 app. I tried to set up typescript to work but kept running into problems. This is frustrating for me because I have used typescript with vue before, but as a received app I cloned, not through creating the app. Anyhow, this apps works with js, I included a type interface inside src/types, you can see my interface for Characters, if ts would have worked I could have used this.
